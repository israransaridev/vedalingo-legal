<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p>Last updated: <strong>November 29, 2025</strong></p>

<p>
This Privacy Policy describes how the <strong>Vedalingo</strong> mobile application 
(“the App”, “we”, “our”, or “us”) handles your information. Your privacy is extremely important to us.
</p>

<h2>1. Information We Do Not Collect</h2>
<p>The Vedalingo app does <strong>not</strong> collect, store, share, or upload any personally identifiable information (PII). Specifically, we do not collect:</p>

<ul>
    <li>❌ Name</li>
    <li>❌ Email address</li>
    <li>❌ Phone number</li>
    <li>❌ Photos, videos, contacts</li>
    <li>❌ Location</li>
    <li>❌ Device identifiers</li>
    <li>❌ Login or account details</li>
</ul>

<p>
The app operates completely <strong>without user registration</strong> and does not ask for any personal data.
</p>

<h2>2. Translation Data</h2>
<p>
The App provides <strong>Hindi → Sanskrit</strong> and <strong>Sanskrit → Hindi</strong> translation features.  
The text entered by the user is used only to generate translations.  
We do <strong>not store, upload, or analyze</strong> your translation data on any server.
</p>

<p>
For convenience, your translation history is stored locally on your device only, using local storage.  
This data:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>✔ Remains on your device</li>
    <li>✔ Is not uploaded to any server</li>
    <li>✔ Can be deleted anytime by clearing app data</li>
</ul>

<h2>3. Internet Usage</h2>
<p>
The App requires an active internet connection to fetch translation results.  
Other than sending your entered text for translation processing, we do not transmit any additional information.
</p>

<h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
<p>
The App uses third-party services for monetization and translation purposes. These may collect some information as part of their own operations.
</p>

<h3>4.1 Google AdMob</h3>
<p>
We display Google Ads to support development.  
Google AdMob may automatically collect certain data such as:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Advertising ID</li>
    <li>App usage data</li>
    <li>Device information for ad personalization</li>
</ul>

<p>
This information is handled directly by Google under their privacy policy:  
<a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">https://policies.google.com/privacy</a>
</p>

<h3>4.2 Translation API</h3>
<p>
The App uses an AI translation API to process text and return translation results.  
No personal data is shared—only the text you enter for translation is sent temporarily for processing.
</p>

<h2>5. Children’s Privacy</h2>
<p>
Vedalingo does not collect any personal information from children or adults.  
The App is safe for all age groups.
</p>

<h2>6. Data Security</h2>
<p>
Since Vedalingo does not store any personal data, the risk of data loss or misuse is minimal.  
Local translation history stored on your device is under your full control.
</p>

<h2>7. Links to Other Sites</h2>
<p>
The App does not contain external links other than advertising links provided through Google AdMob.
</p>

<h2>8. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time.  
Any changes will be reflected on this page with an updated “Last Updated” date.
</p>
